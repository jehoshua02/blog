For non-fiction, it is actually quite different in that you don't have characters sabotaging your plans and taking the story in a different direction. However, I would not write the outline first. Do the research. Otherwise new information will derail your outline. You will also need to determine whether or not you're going to be citing these sources in your book, in which case you'll need to learn the correct bibliography stuff for publication. I'm not the one to ask about that. 

But in terms of a plan.... Yes, set aside time. Whether it's something like an hour a day or a bigger block once a week, try to make that time non-negotiable. Your schedule and your ability to focus quickly will determine which system works best for you. 

Roughly speaking, your order of process would be like this:

1. research
2. organize your thoughts and refine your goal
3. create outline that speaks to that goal and makes a logical flow of ideas
4. write each chapter based on the outline, citing as you go as necessary; I suggest not editing too much as you go, or you can get bogged down; give yourself a word count goal for each work session (i.e. 1000 words in x hours)--be realistic, but challenge yourself so you don't just sit there staring at the wall or grabbing a snack
5. when you finish the last chapter, set the work aside for a week and do something else
6. get yourself a social media platform (blog, FB, Twitter, LinkedIn, etc.) that will be most appropriate for finding people in your intended audience
7. come back with fresh eyes and read it aloud to make sure it make sense and to catch stupid mechanical errors
8. make revisions as needed
9. give it to "beta readers" (preferably a few of them if you can find 'em); these should be people in your target audience who can tell you whether or not you're hitting the mark; having them proofread is optional at this point; as they read, they're making comments in the margins about their reactions, what's clear, what's confusing, what could be moved/deleted, etc.
10. digest their feedback and make revisions as needed; you'll have had time to wait for them, so you'll be able to see your manuscript with fresh eyes again
11. rinse and repeat steps 9 & 10 as many times as you can handle it; the worst thing you can do is rush an unfinished, sloppy product out there because IF it even gets reviewed, it'll get slaughtered, thus killing your chance to sell it to anyone else. This is important. DON'T RUSH THIS PROCESS. It's harder for fiction, but figure I typically go through about 6-8 drafts.
12. format it for your desired medium (ebook, paperback, etc.); when you get there, holler.
13. have a proof reader grammar geek type person check over this draft to make sure it contains no mechanical or formatting errors
14. look at covers for books in your genre and then design your own and/or get help from someone who knows how
15. choose your self-publishing platform (i.e. Amazon KDP, Createspace, Smashwords, Barnes & Noble Nook, etc.) and upload as per their instructions
16. get a marketing plan in place
17. "Launch" the book by hitting "publish" and starting your selling campaign in the appropriate venues.
18. spend more time than you want to trying to get people to buy your brilliant masterpiece ðŸ˜‰

This is not something a novice can typically bang out in a couple of months. I average 1000 words a day with very few mechanical errors.  I say this in love, but knowing how easily distracted you are, and how busy you are--figure at least a year. You're essentially writing a dissertation when you publish a nonfiction book of a research variety subject.

Clear as mud? You can do this, but be aware of what you're starting!
