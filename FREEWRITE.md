To satisfy the goal of this book we need to establish what we mean by "ideal" pertaining
to application architecture. For me it really boils down to this: __simple__. And simple equals
easy. Easy to teach, easy to learn, easy to build, easy to test, easy to
maintain. But simple does not mean stupid. An ideal application architecture
will not overlook any legitimate need of the application. So ideal to me also 
means ROBUST. Otherwise certain parts of the application would be patched on
in an ad-hoc kind of way that won't be *easy to maintain (or teach, learn, build, test, etc.)*, violating
the first principle of ideal application architecture of simplicity.

So an ideal application architecture is both simple and robust.
